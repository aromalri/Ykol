  heading: Why Ykol?
  text: >-
    Ykol is an initiative of a group of young architects who believe in
    sustainable agriculture and the nature. We work in our field so that we can
    know the pulse of the soil.



    We hope our humble venture could attract more young minds to the world of
    organic farming, both in physical labour and technological support. This is
    especially important in the present scenario when there is an alarming issue
    of concern in food adulteration and various health issues connected with
    that.

      We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
      tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
      own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget to
      fall in love with in our shop.
values:
  heading: Our values
  text: >-
    We believe in gender equality in workplace, be it a comfy office within four
    walls or an open paddy field. Equal pay for men and women is one thing we
    strictly follow. 


    We believe a safe and comfortable work space increases significantly the
    productivity of our farmers, a section of society often less credited and
    acknowledged by society. Ensuring an increased sense of dignity and
    satisfaction among our farmers is one value we proudly adhere to.
